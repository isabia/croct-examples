        The download action allows retrieving files dynamically. This is useful for fetching assets,
        code snippets, or configuration files during template execution.

        Supported sources include:
         - Public URLs (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS links)
         - GitHub repositories using a special protocol
         - Local paths relative to the template

        GitHub repository URLs can be specified in two formats:
         - Web interface URL: https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/<blob|tree>/<ref>/path/to/file-or-folder
         - Short GitHub URL: github:///<username>/<repo>/path/to/file-or-folder
